    <h3>Map Description</h3>
    <p>
      The brutality of the police against people of color is getting worse every
      day and there are little to no consequences for the officers involved in
      these cases. For my research, I started with some statistics relating to
      police brutality against minorities. My map will depict various police
      brutality cases with minorities around the United States. I created a legend
      with symbols for the police (badge), the victim (red starburst), protests (brown
      fists of different shades), and riots (flame). Next, I want to code my icons
      to be interactive by displaying information when they are clicked on by the user.
