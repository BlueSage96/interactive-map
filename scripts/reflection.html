    <h3> My predictions/Reflection </h3>
    <!-- Looking forward to the updates and what you are anticipating for the future if this situation gets worse. -->
    Overall, I am a bit disheartended about these cases.
    I am glad that many people are finally to push back even more with protests.
    However, I do not condone looting and rioting nor attacking police officers who are trying to help.
    I try to do my part by sharing these stories on social media. I have not joined a protest mainly
    because the one in my hometown was not advertised well. As for the future, I believe that there
    will be more positive changes than set backs when it comes to the question if black lives matter.
