    <h3>Statistics</h3>

        <li>
          African Americans are five times more likely to be stopped by the police than white people <a href="bib.html">(NAACP 2020)</a>.
        </li>

        <li>
          Black men are two times as likely than black women to be stopped without just cause <a href="bib.html">(NAACP 2020)</a>.

          "65% of Black adults have felt targeted because of their race. Similarly, approximately 35% of Latino
          and Asian adults have felt targeted because of race" <a href="bib.html">(NAACP 2020)</a>.
        </li>

        <li>
          From 2019 to 2020, 1,025 people have been shot and killed by the police <a href="bib.html">(NAACP 2020)</a>.

        <li>
          Approximately 900 to 1,100 people are shot and killed by the police in the United States <a href="bib.html">(NAACP 2020)</a>.
        </li>

        <li>
          As of 2005, only 98 non-federal law enforcement officers have been arrested after being involved in fatal, on-duty shootings.
          The NAACP notes that as of this year, only 35 of the 98 officers have been convicted of a crime. However, they are often
          given a lesser sentence than murder such as manslaughter or negligent homicide. Currently, three officers have been convicted of murder
          and have seen their convictions stand <a href="bib.html">(NAACP 2020)</a>. "Another 22 officers
          were acquitted in a jury trial and nine were acquitted during a bench trial decided by a judge" <a href="bib.html">(NAACP 2020)</a>.
          There have been ten other cases that have been dismissed by a judge or prosecutor, and in one of these cases, the grand jury did
          not return a verdict. Presently, 21 non-federal law enforcement officers have pending criminal cases because of fatal shootings

          A 2019 research on police policies concluded that 84% of African American adults believe that white people are treated by better
          by police. Meanwhile, 63% of Caucasian Americans agree with this sentiment <a href="bib.html">(NAACP 2020)</a>.
        </li>

        <li>
          Moreover, 87% African American adults believe that the United States criminal justice system is more biased towards them than
          white people. 61% of Caucasian Americans surveyed agree with this notion <a href="bib.html">(NAACP 2020)</a>.
        </li>

        <li>
          Although more white people are killed by the police, Latino and Black people are excessively impacted by this police brutality.
          Caucasian Americans only count for around 41% of fatal police shootings despite the fact that they represent just over 60% of
          the US population. Meanwhile, African Americans make up approximately 13.4% of the population but are 22% of the fatal police shootings.
          Of course, these statistics do not factor in other police brutality practices such as non-lethal police shootings <a href="bib.html">(NAACP 2020)</a>.

          "Police killings of unarmed Black Americans are responsible for more than 50 million additional days
          of poor mental health per year among Black Americans. This mental health burden is comparable to
          that associated with diabetes, a disease that strikes 1 in 5 Black Americans" <a href="bib.html">(NAACP 2020)</a>.
